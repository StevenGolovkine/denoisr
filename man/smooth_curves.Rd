\title{Perform a non-parametric smoothing of a set of curves}
\usage{
smooth_curves(data, U = NULL, t0_list = 0.5, k0_list = 2, K = "epanechnikov")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list, where each element represents a curve. Each curve have to
be defined as a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \strong{$t} The sampling points
\item \strong{$x} The observed points.
}}

\item{U}{A vector of numerics, sampling points at which estimate the curves.
If NULL, the sampling points for the estimation are the same than the
observed ones.}

\item{t0_list}{A vector of numerics, the sampling points at which we estimate
\eqn{H0}. We will consider the \eqn{8k0 - 7} nearest points of \eqn{t_0} for
the estimation of \eqn{H_0} when \eqn{\sigma} is unknown.}

\item{k0_list}{A vector of numerics, the number of neighbors of \eqn{t_0} to
consider. Should be set as \deqn{k0 = M* exp(-log(log(M))^2)}. We can set a
different \eqn{k_0}, but in order to use the same for each \eqn{t_0}, just
put a unique numeric.}

\item{K}{Character string, the kernel used for the estimation:
\itemize{
\item epanechnikov (default)
\item uniform
\item beta
}}
}
\value{
A list, which contains two elements. The first one is a list which
contains the estimated parameters:
\itemize{
\item \strong{sigma} An estimation of the standard deviation of the noise
\item \strong{H0} An estimation of \eqn{H_0}
\item \strong{L0} An estimation of \eqn{L_0}
\item \strong{b} An estimation of the bandwidth
}
The second one is another list which contains the estimation of the curves:
\itemize{
\item \strong{$t} The sampling points
\item \strong{$x} The estimated points.
}
}
\description{
This function performs a non-parametric smoothing of a set of curves using the
Nadaraya-Watson estimator. The bandwidth is estimated using the method from
\cite{add ref}.

\examples{
X <- generate_fractional_brownian(N = 1000, M = 300, H = 0.5, sigma = 0.05)
X_smooth <- smooth_curves(X)

X <- generate_piecewise_fractional_brownian(N = 1000, M = 300, 
                                            H = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8), 
                                            sigma = 0.05)
