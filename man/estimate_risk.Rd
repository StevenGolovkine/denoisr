\title{Perform an estimation of the risk on a set of curves at a particular point.}
\usage{
estimate_risk(curves, curves_estim, t0_list = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{curves}{A list, where each element represents a real curve. Each curve
have to be defined as a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \strong{$t} The sampling points
\item \strong{$x} The observed points.
}}

\item{curves_estim}{A list, where each element represents an estimated curve.
Each curve have to be defined as a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \strong{$t} The sampling points
\item \strong{$x} The estimated points.
}}

\item{t0_list}{A vector of numerics, sampling points where the risk will be
computed. Can have a single value.}
}
\value{
A list, with the mean and max residual squared error in \eqn{t_0}.
}
\description{
This function performs the estimation of the risk on a set of curves at a
particular sampling points \eqn{t_0}. Both the real and estimated curves have
to be sampled on the same grid.
}
\details{
Actually, two risks are computed. They are defined as:
\deqn{MeanRSE(t_0) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}(X_n(t_0) - \hat{X}_n(t_0))^2}
and
\deqn{MeanRSE(t_0) = \max_{1 \leq n \leq N} (X_n(t_0) - \hat{X}_n(t_0))^2}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 X <- generate_fractional_brownian(N = 1000, M = 300, H = 0.5, sigma = 0.05)
 X_smoothed <- smooth_curves(X)$smooth
 estimate_risk(X, X_smoothed, t0_list = 0.5)
