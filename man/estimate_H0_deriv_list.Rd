\title{Perform an estimation of \eqn{H_0} given a list of \eqn{t_0} when the curves
are derivable}
\usage{
estimate_H0_deriv_list(data, t0_list, eps = 0.01, k0_list = 2, sigma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list, where each element represents a curve. Each curve have to
be defined as a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \strong{$t} The sampling points
\item \strong{$x} The observed points.
}}

\item{t0_list}{A vector of numerics, the sampling points at which we estimate
\eqn{H0}. We will consider the \eqn{8k0 - 7} nearest points of \eqn{t_0} for
the estimation of \eqn{H_0} when \eqn{\sigma} is unknown. Be careful not to
consider \eqn{t_0} close to the bound of the interval because local
polynomials do not behave well in this case.}

\item{eps}{Numeric, precision parameter. It is used to control how much larger
than 1, we have to be in order to consider to have a regularity larger than 1
(default to 0.01). Should be set as \deqn{\epsilon = log^{-2}(M)}.}

\item{k0_list}{A vector of numerics, the number of neighbors of \eqn{t_0} to
consider. Should be set as \deqn{k0 = M * exp(-log(log(M))^2)}. We can set a
different \eqn{k_0}, but in order to use the same for each \eqn{t_0}, just
put a unique numeric.}

\item{sigma}{Numeric, true value of sigma. Can be NULL.}
}
\value{
A vector of numeric, an estimation of \eqn{H_0} at each \eqn{t_0}.
}
\description{
This function performs an estimation of \eqn{H_0} used for the estimation of
the bandwidth for a univariate kernel regression estimator defined over
continuous domains data using the method of \cite{Golovkine et al. (2020)}
in the case the curves are derivables.
